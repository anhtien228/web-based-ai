    "The notebook consists the fine tuning process BART model from Hugging Face (created by ssleifer), which already had a good performance on summarizing the text documents. Since there are also many datasets out there, I want to try fine tuning the model to see whether its performance is improved, and how the tuning process will affect it regarding different use-cases.\n",

In future work, I'd also want to try out the BARTpho model (created by VinAI) that is specifically used for Vietnamese text summarization, and  the **vietnamese** portion from the wiki_lingua dataset."

      "   0  Does a musical score hold the secret of hidden Nazi gold? In scenes reminiscent of an Indiana Jones movie, a Dutch film-maker has started digging in a Bavarian town, believing annotations made by Hitler's aide Martin Bormann on a piece of sheet music will guide him to the gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "       The theory was first developed by the Dutch writer Karl Hammer Kaatee last year, when he published scans of decades-old sheet music that was allegedly marked-up by Bormann. There's nothing exceptional about the music – Gottfried Federlein's Marsch-Impromptu – but Kaatee was drawn to the pages' hand-drawn scribbles and mysterious annotations. In the waning days of the second world war, he argued, Bormann used Marsch-Impromptu to secretly convey the location of a buried fortune: at least 100 gold bars, plus Hitler's personal collection of diamonds, known as the \"tears of the wolf\". The Führer supposedly intended for the document to reach Nazi party accountant Franz Xaver Schwarz in Munich; instead, Schwarz was arrested.\n",
      "\n",
      "       Now, 51-year-old film-maker Leon Giesen believes he has cracked the code and has already staged three excavations in the town of Mittenwald, in Bavaria, guided by Bormann's markings. According to Spiegel Online, Giesen's theory is centred on the hand-written phrase, \"Wo Matthias die Saiten Streichelt\" (\"where Matthew plucks strings\"). This, he claims, is a reference to Mittenwald luthier Matthias Klotz, one of the town's most famous residents. Another phrase, \"Enden der Tanz\" (\"end the dance\") is purportedly an allusion to one of the local railway's buffer stops. The sheet music may even contain a concealed diagram of the city's train tracks.\n",
      "\n",
      "       Working separately from Kaatee, Giesen is using crowdfunding to finance further Mittenwald digs. The initial drillings were reportedly fruitful: diggers found \"anomalous\" metals, Giesen told Der Spiegel. \"[It] cold be a treasure chest,\" admitted Jürgen Proske, a local historian and amateur archaeologist, \"but it could just be a manhole cover.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "       It is possible sceptics might look at Karl Hammer Kaatee's other work and doubt the likelihood of the music containing a code. For example, his 2006 book Satan's Song purported to be a fictionalised version of the true story of the CIA's hunt for Jesus. ||||| Three attempts have been made in recent weeks to find buried Nazi treasure in the Bavarian town of Mittenwald, close to the Austrian border. Even though the holes in the ground have since been filled, the traces left by drills and blue markings are still visible below a thin layer of autumn leaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "       Authorities granted permission for the undertaking in \"a bid for clarity,\" and before too long, the story was making headlines in local papers. \"The Hunt for Nazi Gold,\" the Garmisch-Partenkirchner Tagblatt called it.\n",
      "\n",
      "       Residents' reactions range from annoyed to amused. \"I've never seen anything like it,\" says one. \"I can't wait to see what they find down there,\" says another.\n",
      "\n",
      "       Behind it all is 51-year-old Leon Giesen, a Dutch filmmaker and musician with a tantalizing theory. He is convinced that Nazi treasure is languishing below Mittenwald's roads -- gold or diamonds, at the very least.\n",
      "\n",
      "       The whole idea of Nazi gold has long held a grip on the public imagination, and as a former Nazi stronghold, Bavaria provides fertile soil for many an aspiring Indiana Jones. In 1944, with the Allies and the Soviet Army threatening to advance, it was here that Heinrich Himmler, one of the most powerful men in Nazi Germany, planned to build an Alpine Fortress -- a national redoubt where Nazi Germany would fight from until the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "       And that's not all. In April 1945, the Wehrmacht armed forces and officials of the Reichsbank approved a plan to store at least part of the reserves of the German Reichsbank at Einsiedl, a small town on the southwest shore of Lake Walchen. Much of these assets were handed over to the Allies, but around 100 gold bars, sacks of dollars and Swiss francs and possibly even more hoards went missing.\n",
      "\n",
      "       'Like a Treasure Map'\n",
      "\n",
      "       Even though Giesen's theory is an outlandish one by any standards, it has generated reams of publicity in his native Netherlands. It revolves around an annotated score of the \"March Impromptu\" by composer Gottfried Federlein.\n",
      "\n",
      "       Legend has it that in the final days of World War II, Adolf Hitler's private secretary Martin Bormann scribbled letters, figures and runes on the score that form a code giving the coordinates of the hidden Nazi treasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "       Supposedly, a military chaplain was tasked with taking the score to someone in Munich. But it apparently never arrived, instead ending up decades later in the hands of Dutch journalist Karl Hammer Kaatee.\n",
      "\n",
      "       After spending years attempting to crack the code, he finally made the score public last December and was promptly deluged with e-mails and suggestions. Even though there is no proof that the document is genuine, it exerts a magic pull on many.\n",
      "\n",
      "       \"It's like a treasure map that can't be deciphered,\" says Jürgen Proske, a local historian from Garmisch-Partenkirchen and a hobby archeologist who has located Wehrmacht paraphernalia and a wine cellar from 1940 in the mountains around Mittenwald and Garmisch-Partenkirchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "       The Mystery of Mittenwald\n",
      "\n",
      "       But filmmaker Giesen now believes he's solved the mystery, maintaining that the line added to the score that reads \"Wo Matthias die Saiten Streichelt\" (\"where Matthew plucks strings\") is a reference to Mittenwald and its famous son Matthias Klotz, who founded the town's violinmaking tradition. Moreover, he contends that the score contains a schematic diagram of the train tracks that ran through Mittenwald in the 1940s, and that the rune and fragmented sentence \"Enden der Tanz\" (\"end the dance\") at the end of the score means the treasure can be found at the former site of the buffer stops.\n",
      "\n",
      "       The drilling effort in Mittenwald proved fruitful, unearthing a large quantity of unidentified metals. \"Geologists call it an anomaly, a substance that doesn't belong there,\" says Giesen. He is now looking for a company specialized in excavations and dealing with explosives to continue the hunt, and is hoping to pay the costs by raising 25,000 with a crowdfunding campaign. He is also considering making a documentary about the project.\n",

      "   4  When next winter's storms subside, a specialized ship will begin a slow crossing, lowering a skinny cable into its wake along a precisely prescribed path: the shortest distance between New York and London. Owned by Summit, N.J.-based Hibernia Atlantic, the $300 million wire will bring the two financial capitals 5.2 milliseconds closer together—a boon to high-speed electronic traders.\n",
      "\n",
      "       Four thousand miles to the south, a second ship owned by a different company will move in parallel, laying a cable that will link—for the first time—Brazil and Angola. And in 2014, it will happen again, twice: from Virginia Beach to San Sebastián, Spain, and from Brazil to Nigeria. For those with memories of the global cable-laying spree that helped to drive telecommunications companies into bankruptcy in the 1990s, this will raise eyebrows. But all those cables are nearly full now. And there are other parts of the world demanding direct connections.\n",
      "\n",
      "       Photos: Undersea Communications Cables Connect Continents View Slideshow Andrew Blum The precise point of connection is known as 'the beach manhole,' a small underground vault where the undersea cable is tied to terra firma.\n",
      "\n",
      "       If the Internet is a global phenomenon, it's because there are tubes underneath the ocean. They are the fundamental medium of the global village.\n",
      "\n",
      "       The fiber-optic technology is fantastically complex and dependent on the latest materials and computing technology. Yet the basic principle of the cables is shockingly simple: Light goes in on one shore of the ocean and comes out on the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "       At each end of the cable is a landing station, around the size of a large house, often tucked away inconspicuously in a quiet seaside neighborhood. It is a lighthouse; its fundamental purpose is to illuminate the fiber-optic strands. To make the light travel enormous distances, thousands of volts of electricity are sent through the cable's copper sleeve to power repeaters, each the size and roughly the shape of a bluefin tuna. One rests on the ocean floor every 50 miles or so. Inside its pressurized case is a miniature racetrack of the element erbium, which, when energized, gooses along the photons, like a waterwheel.\n",
      "\n",
      "       It's all wonderfully poetic, an ultimate enjoining of the unfathomable mysteries of the digital world with the even more unfathomable mysteries of the oceans.\n",
      "\n",
      "       How does it all work? One company might own the fiber-optic cables, while another operates the light signals pulsing over that fiber, and a third owns (or more likely rents) the bandwidth encoded in that light. The dozen or so cables that cross the Atlantic are owned by boutique outfits like Hibernia Atlantic and Apollo; consortia of incumbent telecoms like Verizon, Sprint and Deutsche Telekom; or \"backbones\" with less familiar names, like Level 3 and Tata Communications. They sell passage to any company that operates its own global data network: from Qatar Telecom to Swisscom, Facebook to Goldman Sachs. Prices are perpetually falling. As the Englishmen who dominate the undersea cable industry like to say, the capacity they're selling is too often \"cheap as chips.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "       Determining a cable's route requires navigating a maze of economics, geopolitics and topography. Specialized ships conduct surveys of the ocean bottom, plotting routes over and around underwater mountains. The paths carefully avoid major shipping lanes, to limit the risk of damage from dragging anchors. If a cable does fail, a repair ship is dispatched to lift both ends to the surface using grappling hooks and fuse the ends back together—a slow, expensive process.\n",
      "\n",
      "       Further complicating matters is the demand for low \"latency,\" the networking term for how long it takes information to travel across the cable. Latency used to be a concern only for the telephone people, eager to avoid an unnatural delay in conversations. Now it's become an obsession of the financial industry, to serve the needs of high-speed automated trading, where computers arbitrage based on knowing the market news an extra millisecond in advance. Since the speed of light through a cable is consistent, the difference is entirely in the length of its path. Hibernia Atlantic is shaving 310 miles off the current trans-Atlantic journey, by following the shallow continental shelf (despite the heightened risk of damage).\n",
      "\n",
      "       But even in our every-millisecond-counts world, the cables' paths are often ancient, landing in or near classic port cities like Marseille, Mumbai and Mombasa. It may feel as if the Internet has created an entirely new world, but it's traced entirely upon the outlines of the old one.\n",

      "       Information moves, or we move to it. Moving to it has rarely been popular and is growing unfashionable; nowadays we demand that the information come to us. This can be accomplished in three basic ways: moving physical media around, broadcasting radiation through space, and sending signals through wires. This article is about what will, for a short time anyway, be the biggest and best wire ever made.\n",
      "\n",
      "       Wires warp cyberspace in the same way wormholes warp physical space: the two points at opposite ends of a wire are, for informational purposes, the same point, even if they are on opposite sides of the planet. The cyberspace-warping power of wires, therefore, changes the geometry of the world of commerce and politics and ideas that we live in. The financial districts of New York, London, and Tokyo, linked by thousands of wires, are much closer to each other than, say, the Bronx is to Manhattan.\n",
      "\n",
      "       Today this is all quite familiar, but in the 19th century, when the first feeble bits struggled down the first undersea cable joining the Old World to the New, it must have made people's hair stand up on end in more than just the purely electrical sense - it must have seemed supernatural. Perhaps this sort of feeling explains why when Samuel Morse stretched a wire between Washington and Baltimore in 1844, the first message he sent with his code was \"What hath God wrought!\" - almost as if he needed to reassure himself and others that God, and not the Devil, was behind it.\n",
      "\n",
      "       During the decades after Morse's \"What hath God wrought!\" a plethora of different codes, signalling techniques, and sending and receiving machines were patented. A web of wires was spun across every modern city on the globe, and longer wires were strung between cities. Some of the early technologies were, in retrospect, flaky: one early inventor wanted to use 26-wire cables, one wire for each letter of the alphabet. But it quickly became evident that it was best to keep the number of individual wires as low as possible and find clever ways to fit more information onto them.\n",
      "\n",
      "       This requires more ingenuity than you might think - wires have never been perfectly transparent carriers of data; they have always degraded the information put into them. In general, this gets worse as the wire gets longer, and so as the early telegraph networks spanned greater distances, the people building them had to edge away from the seat-of-the-pants engineering practices that, applied in another field, gave us so many boiler explosions, and toward the more scientific approach that is the standard of practice today.\n",
      "\n",
      "       Still, telegraphy, like many other forms of engineering, retained a certain barnyard, improvised quality until the Year of Our Lord 1858, when the terrifyingly high financial stakes and shockingly formidable technical challenges of the first transatlantic submarine cable brought certain long-simmering conflicts to a rolling boil, incarnated the old and new approaches in the persons of Dr. Wildman Whitehouse and Professor William Thomson, respectively, and brought the conflict between them into the highest possible relief in the form of an inquiry and a scandal that rocked the Victorian world. Thomson came out on top, with a new title and name - Lord Kelvin.\n",
      "\n",
      "       Everything that has occurred in Silicon Valley in the last couple of decades also occurred in the 1850s. Anyone who thinks that wild-ass high tech venture capitalism is a late-20th-century California phenomenon needs to read about the maniacs who built the first transatlantic cable projects (I recommend Arthur C. Clarke's book How the World Was One). The only things that have changed since then are that the stakes have gotten smaller, the process more bureaucratized, and the personalities less interesting. |||||\n",

      "   0  – It's quite the fanciful story: Nazis buried diamonds and 100 gold bars in a Bavarian town during World War II, in a spot whose location was encoded into an annotated piece of sheet music by Adolf Hitler's private secretary. That score, to Gottfried Federlein's \"March Impromptu,\" was posted online in December by stumped Dutch journalist Karl Hammer, reports der Spiegel. Now, a 51-year-old fellow Dutchman who spent nine months poring over what NBC News describes as \"letters, figures, and lyrics\" added to the score thinks he has an answer—or, at least, a \"very good theory.\" Leon Giesen spotted a distinct capital \"M,\" which seemed familiar to him: An image of a Berlin train station had contained the same letter. He now believes the \"M\" stands for Mittenwald, where Nazi barracks once stood, and that the phrase Enden der Tanz, or \"end the dance,\" refers to one of the rail line's buffer stops, reports the Guardian. If you're doubtful, there's also this: Giesen thinks an added lyric (wo Matthias die Saiten streichelt, \"where Matthew plucks strings\") refers to 17th-century violin builder Matthias Klotz, who hailed from that same town. Giesen got the go-ahead to drill three holes in Mittenwald, and says his \"geophysical survey\" revealed an \"anomaly\" in the earth. Next up: Raise more money for a full excavation, which is no small task. \"If there are boxes with valuable items below the surface they could be booby-trapped, so we need to bring in specialists and meet all safety requirements first.\" (More treasure-related news: Jewels have been found atop the French Alps.)\n",
      "   1  – Heather Menzies-Urich, who played Louisa von Trapp in The Sound of Music, died Christmas Eve at the age of 68, TMZ reports. Her son, Ryan Urich, says she had been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer a month earlier. \"She was an actress, a ballerina, and loved living her life to the fullest,\" Urich says. Menzies-Urich is survived by her children, grandchildren, and a great grandchild. Her husband, actor and producer Robert Urich, died in 2002, according to the BBC. Menzies-Urich, born in Toronto, was cast in the Oscar-winning The Sound of Music at the age of 15 after getting her start in acting the year before. It was to be her most famous role. \"We are all lucky to have known her, and she will happily live on in that beautiful movie,\" says Ted Chapin of the estate of Rodgers & Hammerstein, the creators of the musical.\n",
      "   2  – London's bike thieves are getting extra crafty. On Friday, a police officer tweeted photos of a bike rack that had been sliced through and then taped back together to hide the cuts from the city's unsuspecting cyclists, per Boing Boing. Sarah King, a councilor for South Camberwell, tells the Evening Standard that she locked her bike to such a rack before a meeting in the London borough on Thursday. She returned to find her bike was missing and figured out the trick when she noticed the tape and gave a push. A police rep says she's never heard of the trick before, notes the Huffington Post, which describes collective online reaction as one of \"reluctant admiration.\" Others are less impressed. \"It is appalling that the growing cycling population in the borough are being targeted by these cunning thieves,\" another local councilor tells the BBC. \"The more publicity that can be given to this, the better,\" a rep for a cycling charity adds. The lesson for cyclists, then: Beware public racks with tape.\n",
      "   3  – Anyone who’s waited by the mailbox for an important letter or much-needed paycheck will want to be first in line for a new free service USPS is rolling out widely in mid-April. Residential customers who sign up for Informed Delivery will receive a daily email with high-quality photo scans of their incoming envelope fronts, reports NBC News. The emails display up to 10 images—if there are more than 10 on a given day, the rest can be viewed via a link that stays active for seven days. After receiving “tremendously positive” feedback in pilot test runs, executive program director Bob Dixon says the program has been particularly appealing to people living with roommates, since they’re not always first to retrieve their daily mail. Frequent travelers are another group utilizing the service, which Dixon personally attests to as one of Informed Delivery’s first users. He tells NPR that he was able to flag a jury duty summons while on the road and asked his son to set it aside so it didn’t get lost in a towering mail pile. With the rate of mail delivery declining (61.2 billion pieces of first-class mail were handled by USPS in 2016 compared to 98 billion in 2006), the service is one way the post office is innovating and trying to remain relevant. \"Our emerging consumers, younger folks, are digital natives,\" Dixon says. \"That's how their communications are coming to them.\" USPS has opened sign-up for Informed Delivery at: informeddelivery.USPS.com. (Finland's postal service tried to innovate in a different way.)\n",
      "   4  – Our Internet age didn't just happen; it required thousands of miles of cables crisscrossing the ocean like veins and arteries (or, as Neal Stephenson put it years ago in Wired, turning the Earth into a computer motherboard). After a huge boom-and-bust cycle in the 1990s, the world's telecommunications cables are full, so once again ships are braving the oceans to lay new batches of the mammoth fiber optic wires that undergird the modern economy and allow you to order all sorts of useless stuff. Author Andrew Blum, who has a new book on the subject (Tubes), offers an overview in the Wall Street Journal. Brazil-to-Angola; Virginia Beach-to-San Sebastian, Spain; and New York-to-London (of course) are three of the new cables going in. Undersea cables pass through power repeaters every 50 miles on their immense journeys, ending at a \"beach manhole\" where the cable is secured to the land. Near the manhole is a landing station, responsible for sending and receiving the signals. And the cables, signals, and equipment are all run in a complicated cross-owned and -leased network of companies. It's all about capacity and speed, as the latest New York-London route is being carefully planned to shave 310 miles off the distance—and save high-speed traders a precious 5.2 milliseconds.\n"
